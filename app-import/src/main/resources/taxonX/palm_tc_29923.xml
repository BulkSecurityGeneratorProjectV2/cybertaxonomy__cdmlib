Sheaths dull green or grey-green, armed with scattered triangular spines to 10 &#215; 5 mm with conspicuous shaggy-hairy margins, smaller spines and also sometimes with ridges bearing minute spinules, deciduous indumentum present between the spines; knee conspicuous; ocrea scarcely developed. Vestigial flagellum present, to c. 10 cm. Leaf cirrate to 2 m long including petiole to 5 cm and cirrus to 1 m; leaflets c. 30 on each side of the rachis, regularly arranged near the base, somewhat grouped near the tip, the longest to 33 &#215; 1.6 cm, linear, conspicuously bristly on the upper surface, transverse veinlets conspicuous. Young shoots bearing leaves with irregularly grouped leaflets. Inflorescences to 1 m long, usually less, the whole appearing dead; bracts throughout the inflorescence splitting, expanding, tattering, dark brown; male rachillae congested, c. 15 &#215; 2 mm, mostly hidden by subtending bracts; female rachillae curved, c. 40 &#215; 4 mm.

<div type="distribution">Known with certainty only from the 1st Division of Sarawak. The collections from Brunei are similar to a taxon found in the Mulu National Park in Sarawak which has tentatively been identified asC. semoi (see Dransfield 1992). In Brunei this rattan is confined to higher elevations in the Temburong Basin.</div>
