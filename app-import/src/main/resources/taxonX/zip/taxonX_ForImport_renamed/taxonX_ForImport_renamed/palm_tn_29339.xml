<div type="etymology"><lang>Latin</lang> - pointed, referring to the leaflet shape</div>
<div type="vernacular">"rotan padas", "rotan peladas"</div>
<div type="description">Slender clustering rattan with stems climbing to 10 m or more; stem without sheaths to 4 mm, with sheaths to 8 mm; internodes to 20 cm. Sheaths mid-green, with scattered brown scales, unarmed, or rarely with a few scattered spines. Knee well-developed. Ocrea conspicuous, especially on young sheaths, to 15 mm. Flagellum to 1 m. Leaf ecirrate, to 35 cm, with no petiole; leaflets up to 12 on each side of the rachis, regularly arranged, narrow lanceolate to 16 x 2 cm, the lowermost somewhat smaller and swept back across the stem, bright green, shining; terminal leaflet pair joined for under 1/2 of their length; young leaves tinged pink. Male and female inflorescences similar, very similar to those of C. javensis but with more branches. Mature fruit small, spherical, c. 6 mm diam., with a short beak to 1 x 1 mm, and covered in 18 vertical rows of pale straw-coloured scales; seed rounded c 4 mm diam.; endosperm homogeneous. (Fig. 67)</div>
<div type="distribution">Widespread throughout the State, but particularly abundant in the Tenom and Keningau districts.  Endemic to Sabah.</div>
<div type="biology_ecology"></div>
<div type="conservation"></div>
<div type="uses">Widespread local use as twine, perhaps receiving a rudimentary cultivation near villages.</div>
<div type="discussion">Very close to C. javensis but differing in the consistently &#177; regular narrow lanceolate leaflets and the very small spherical fruit. This is very much a feature of the secondary forests of the Tenom / Keningau valleys. It is abundant in roadside belukar, and one can often see its cane for sale in bundles at roadside stalls and in "tamu" (weekly markets).</div>
