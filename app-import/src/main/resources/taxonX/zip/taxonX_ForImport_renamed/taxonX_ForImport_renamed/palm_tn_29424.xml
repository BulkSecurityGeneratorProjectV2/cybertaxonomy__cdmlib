<div type="description">Slender clustering rattan with stems climbing to 20 m; stem without sheaths to 6 mm diam., with to 9 mm; internodes to c 11 cm. Leaf sheath green, tinged crimson, with thin brown indumentum and armed with numerous scattered spines to 3 mm. Knee developed but not very conspicuous. Ocrea short, to 4 mm, tattering. Flagellum to 1 m. Leaf ecirrate to 30 cm, with no petiole; leaflets subregular, broad and beautifully bullate when fresh, about 7 on each side of the rachis, the lowermost pair swept back across the stem; terminal leaflet pair joined for up to l/2 their length; mid leaf leaflets the longest, to 12 x 4 cm, inconspicuously 3-nerved; young leaves tinged pink. Inflorescence only female known, not ending in a flagellum, to 60 cm, curved, with 6 partial inflorescences; partial inflorescences shorter than the conspicuous subtending oblong bract, split down one side, and short spiny; rachillae to 40 x 2.5 mm bearing very congested flowers. Fruit (immature) spherical to 6.5 mm diam., with a conspicuous beak to 2x1 mm, and covered in 21 vertical rows of scarcely grooved greenish scales. Seed c 5 mm diam.; endosperm homogeneous. (Fig. 68)</div>
<div type="distribution">With certainty known only from Nabawan; a sterile specimen from Sapa Payau F.R. is probably this species. Endemic.</div>

<div type="uses">As for C. javensis.</div>
<div type="discussion">C. congestiflorus was collected at the side of a swamp in forest transitional between lowland Dipterocarp forest and kerangas; at Sapa Payau, the sterile specimen was found in a similar habitat. Vegetatively like a neat form of C. javensis with broad bullate leaflets, or a small form of C. amplijugus; yet the congested inflorescence is like neither of these two species.</div>
