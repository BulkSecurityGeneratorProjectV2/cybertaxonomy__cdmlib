<div type="discussion">This species was confused by Ridley with C. caesius but the specimen bears flagellate leaf sheaths and so cannot be this last species. C. moorhousei has been searched for recently in the Kuala Pilah area but with no success. In doing so another new species of Calamus related to C. insignis (C. senalingensis) somewhat similar to C. moorhousei in appearance was found.</div>
