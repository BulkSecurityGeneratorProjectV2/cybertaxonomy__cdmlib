<div type="discussion">This species was found at 1,300 m altitude on G. Padang, in Trengganu. It is very close to Calamus exilis but differs in the absence of small rough spines on the sheaths and in the presence of scattered relatively long spines. It may prove to be only a variety of C. exilis, but in the absence of more material it seems wise to retain it as distinct.</div>
