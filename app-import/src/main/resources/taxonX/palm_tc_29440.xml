<div type="discussion">An understanding of this species is based on the original description. No old herbarium collections are available for study. A recent collection from the Silent Valley of Kerala appeared close to the description of Calamus dellessertianus. Beccari (1908) noted "it is curious that this species which was found in the time of Roxburgh has not been collected again by modern botanists. It seems to me that Calami in lower India are more scarce now than in the past time, perhaps on account of greater extension given to cultivation and owing to destruction of forest".</div>
