<div type="description">Robust clustering rattan tending to form thickets on the landward side of mangrove or behind coastal sand bars; stem climbing to 15 m, without sheaths 2-3.5 cm diam., with sheaths to 5 cm diam., rarely more, internodes to c. 30 cm. Sheaths orange-yellow to yellowish-green when fresh, very densely armed with slender grey-brown spines, 2-35 mm, held horizontally and arranged in horizontal or oblique whorls, spines and sheath epidermis densely covered with grey deciduous indumentum; spines around the leaf sheath mouth upward-pointing, grouped in 5&amp;rsquo;s to 9&amp;rsquo;s, the longest to 60 mm; knee and base of petiole very conspicuous, unarmed, orange-yellow, when young densely covered with indumentum. Leaf cirrate to 4.5 m long including the petiole to 25 cm and cirrus to 2 m; petiole armed along the margins only with grouped spines to 3 cm; leaflets to 70 or more on each side of the rachis, grey-green, very regular, close, limply pendulous, the longest to 40 &#215; 2 cm, armed with short bristles along the margins and on the veins on the lower surface, the lower surface also with white wax and minute brown scales. Inflorescences to 1.5 m with very short peduncle enclosed by the leaf sheath; primary bracts armed with groups of short spines; partial inflorescences about 7 on each side of the axis, gradually decreasing in size distally; male rachillae 1-2 cm long with close distichous flowers; female rachillae 10 cm long with laxer distichous flowers. Fruit rounded, relatively small, to 1 cm diam., covered in 12 vertical rows of straw-coloured scales. Seed rounded, c. 7 mm diam.; endosperm homogeneous. Seedling leaf unknown. (Fig. 32, Pls 8A, 10A)</div>
<div type="distribution">Unaccountably rare in Brunei, known from a single collection. Elsewhere abundant in coastal formations throughout Borneo, Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia and S Thailand, very rare inland.</div>

<div type="uses">Produces a medium to low quality coarse cane.</div>
<div type="discussion">C. erinaceus is an unmistakable and very beautiful species. It is one of the distinctive features of forest on the landward fringe of the mangrove; very rarely it can be found away from mangrove, but always near to the sea. Why it should be so rare in Brunei is not understood.</div>
