<div type="discussion">C. paulii is found in hill dipterocarp forest at 600 - 800 m altitude, on slopes and ridges. It is an elegant species; it differs from C. myriacanthus in the much smaller size of all its parts, the very regular leaf sheath spines and in the form of the leaflets and inflorescences.</div>
