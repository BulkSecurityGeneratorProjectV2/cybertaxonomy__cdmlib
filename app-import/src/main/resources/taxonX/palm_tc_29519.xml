<div type="description">Slender clustering rattan climbing to 20 m or more; stem without sheaths to 6 mm diam., with sheaths to 12 mm, internodes to 15 cm. All parts drying dark dirty-coloured. Sheaths dark green with scattered reflexed broad-based spines to 5 mm; knee prominent; ocrea inconspicuous. Flagellum to 2 m. Leaf ecirrate, to 60 cm; petiole short or absent; leaflets 3-4 on each side of the rachis or leaf bearing a single pair of leaflets, lowermost pair of leaflets, where more than 1 pair, to 10 &#215; 1.5 cm, reflexed across the stem; mid leaf leaflets to 17 &#215; 4 cm; apical pair joined for 1/3 to 2/3 their length; leaflets bristly only at the tips, surface bluish-grey tinged, transverse veinlets conspicuous. Inflorescences to c. 1.2 m with c. 6 partial inflorescences, tending to be longer in the female. Ripe fruit spherical to ovoid, to 11 &#215; 7 mm, with beak to 2 mm, covered in 10-12 vertical rows of greenish scales. Seed ovoid, shallowly pitted; endosperm homogeneous. Seedling leaf not known. (Fig. 56).</div>

<div type="uses">An excellent small-diameter cane, useful for binding or weaving.</div>
<div type="discussion">C. flabellatus is primarily a plant of lowland dipterocarp forest at altitudes up to c. 500 m above sea level. Some forms retain the juvenile leaves consisting of a single pair of broad leaflets, even in high-climbing stems. This form was described by Beccari asC. flabellatus. Furtado named those forms with several pairs of leaflets as C. flabelloides. We now have a wide range of specimens of both forms and intermediates have been collected. It is noteworthy that inflorescences have never been found on the form with a single pair of leaflets. This species could be confused with C. javensis and its allies; the inflorescence of C. flabelloides is much finer, young leaves are pale green rather than pinkish and the curious dull bluish-green cast to the leaves of C. flabelloides is absent in C. javensis. C. gonospermus is superficially similar but has well defined petioles.</div>
