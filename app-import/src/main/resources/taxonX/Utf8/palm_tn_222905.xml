Staminate flowers 4 × 2 mm prior to anthesis; calyx 1.8 – 2 mm diam., tubular in basal 1 mm, with 3 lobes to 0.5 mm long, glabrous; corolla 3.5 × 1.5 mm in bud, very briefly tubular at base, glabrous; stamens 6, filaments 2 – 3 × 0.3 – 0.5 mm, anthers 1.5 × 0.4 – 0.7 mm; pistillode minute, to 1 mm long. Pistillate inflorescence similar to staminate inflorescence, 10 – 10.5 cm long including 30 – 40 mm peduncle, branched to 1 order; prophyll 25 – 50 × 2 – 5 mm; peduncular bracts absent or 1, similar to prophyll; rachis bracts 13 – 30 × 3 – 4 mm; primary branches (=rachillae) up to 5, 4 – 20 mm × 1 – 2 mm, 15 – 30 mm apart, recurving; rachilla bracts 0.5 × 1.5 mm, subdistichous, triangular, glabrous; proximal floral bracteole 1 × 0.5 mm, distal floral bracteole 1.2 – 1.7 × 1 – 1.5 mm, glabrous, scar of sterile staminate inconspicuous. Pistillate flowers 4 × 2 mm prior to anthesis; calyx 2 mm diam., tubular in basal 3 mm, with 3 lobes to 0.75 × 1.25 mm, glabrous; corolla 3 × 2 mm, tubular in basal 0.5 mm, with 3 lobes to 2.5 × 1.5 mm, glabrous; staminodes 6, 2 mm long, staminodal ring 0.5 mm high; ovary 1.5 × 1.5 mm, spherical, style 1 mm long, stigmas 1 mm long. Fruit globose, 9.5 × 9 mm including beak to 1 mm long, with 12 – 15 longitudinal rows of smooth scales with minutely fimbriate margins. Seed somewhat immature in available material, 7 × 5.5 × 5 mm, ellipsoid, with a shallow depression on one side; endosperm homogeneous; embryo basal</div>
<div type="distribution">Known from a small area between the Astrolabe Range and the Tinumu Range due east of Port Moresby</div>
<div type="biology_ecology">In understorey of lower montane forest with Lithocarpus and Castanopsis between 650 and 900 m</div>
<div type="conservation">Near threatened. While the forests of the Astrolabe and Tinimu Range are thought to be relatively undisturbed, C. essigii is known from an area so small and in such close proximity to the major urban centre of Port Moresby that the species faces an appreciable level of threat</div>
<div type="uses"></div>
<div type="discussion">Although known only from one pistillate and one sterile collection, C. maturbongsii is unlike any other rattan species, possessing striking features in both leaf and inflorescence morphology (Fig. 1). The inflorescence is rather short, lacks a terminal flagellum and bears primary branches that are congested and held almost parallel to the main axis of the inflorescence. When the primary branches expand, the rachis bracts which subtend them are split into tatters. A similar mechanism of inflorescence expansion occurs in two diminutive species from eastern New Guinea, Calamus anomalus Burret and C. essigii W.J. Baker. In these two taxa, the primary branches burst through the subtending bracts, creating a split at the base of each bract, but, unlike C. maturbongsii, the bract remains intact at its apex. Vegetatively, C. maturbongsii has little in common with these species.  There is some resemblance to another Papuasian rattan, C. nannostachys, but in this species the inflorescence bracts, though inflated and split, do not tatter. In overall structure, the inflorescence of C. maturbongsii resembles those of the group of largely short-stemmed or acaulescent Calamus species belonging to Furtado’s section Platyspathus (Furtado 1955) that are restricted to West Malesia, except that the bracts in this group split neatly rather than tatter.  While the similarities described above are noteworthy, the relationships of C. maturbongsii remain uncertain.
In the majority of pinnate palm leaves, the leaflets near the base of the leaf gradually reduce in size towards the petiole.  In Calamus maturbongsii, the largest leafletsoccur very near the base, with the basal pair almost as large.  This feature together with the very short petiole and almost entirely unarmed leaf sheath must lend the palm a very distinctive appearance. The species is named after our friend and counterpart, Rudi Maturbongs of Universitas Negeri Papua, who has discovered this and many other remarkable new palm species during his field research and has done so much to build collaboration between Papuan botanists and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.
