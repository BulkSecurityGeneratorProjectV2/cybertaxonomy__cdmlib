<div type="description">Solitary (very rarely clustered) moderate high-climbing rattan to 30 m or more; stem without sheaths 8-10 mm diam., with to 20 mm, internodes to 25 cm. Sheaths dull to pale green, drying very pale brownish-green, armed with sparse horizontal &#177; triangular spines borne on swollen bases, sometimes also with very faint horizontal ridges, sometimes unarmed, and with brown scales abundant on young leaf surfaces; knee conspicuous; ocrea scarcely developed. Leaf cirrate to 1 m, including the cirrus to 65 cm; petiole absent; leaflets c. 20 on each side of the rachis, concolorous, arranged irregularly, the basal up to 8 pairs on each side very close and strongly reflexed across the leaf sheaths forming a chamber in which ants frequently nest; upper leaflets in groups of 2-4 and fanned within the groups, the largest leaflets to c. 20 &#215; 0.5-2 cm, somewhat plicate, drying very pale green. Inflorescences usually about the same length as the leaves, without a terminal flagellum, and with up to 10 partial inflorescences; main bracts rather densely armed with black-tipped, pale, bulbous-based spines and brown indumentum, ultimate bracts and bracteoles with abundant minute spines producing a rough feel. Mature fruit rounded, c. 12 mm diam., with a short beak and covered with 15-19 vertical rows of pale straw- to whitish-coloured scales, sometimes flecked with red. Seed rounded, c. 10 mm diam., deeply pitted; endosperm slightly ruminate. Seedling leaf bifid. (Fig. 35, Pl. 10D).</div>
<div type="distribution">Throughout Brunei. Elsewhere throughout Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia, rather rare in Sumatra.</div>
<div type="biology_ecology"></div>
<div type="conservation"></div>
<div type="uses">Produces an excellent cane of the same diameter as rotan sega but as the plant is usually solitary, harvests are not great.</div>
<div type="discussion">C. laevigatus var. laevigatus is a very widespread species occurring at altitudes up to 850 m above sea level and on a variety of soils. This is a very variable taxon. Some forms have very narrow leaflets. This species can easily be seen from the Labi Road in Andulau Forest Reserve.</div>
