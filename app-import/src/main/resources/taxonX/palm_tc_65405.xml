<div type="introduction">Insufficiently known species. This species is known from a single incomplete specimen. The collector described it as growing beside a river and in the water. The inflorescence seems to have a long peduncle and is somewhat reminiscent of those of members of the "Vonitra" group. We are tempted to suggest that this is a stemless rheophyte and those with a mind to try to refind it should perhaps look for a palm with a habit reminiscent of Chamaedorea cataractarum.</div>

<div type="diagnosis">Palma acaulescens verosimiliter rheophytica D. fibrosae affinis folio pinnata pinnis squamas dispersas ramentas ferentibus inflorescentia pedunculo longo terete in 2 ordines ramificanti distincta.</div>  
<div type="description">Trunk very short, if not non-existant (Guillaumet). LEAVES: sheath unknown; petiole part on type 25 cm long, proximally 2 cm diam., deeply channelled, rapidly tapering to the distal diam. 0.8 cm and slightly channelled; rachis c. 8 mm diam. in upper/mid-leaf; leaflets regular, close, the median 21-23.5 x 1.2-1.3 cm, the distal 10-18 x 0.4-1.1 cm, main vein 1, apices unequally acute, indument: adaxial midrib as well as margins with small dark ramenta, abaxial minor veins with dense but scattered minute scales. INFLORESCENCE branched to 2 orders; peduncle at least 21.5 cm and probably considerably longer, 5 x 3 mm diam., glabrous; bracts at least 3 major ones, opening near the apex only, the most distal tubu lar bract 5.5 cm long; non-tubular peduncular bract c. 1 cm long; rachis (one seen) 27.5 cm long, with 12 branches, the proximal 4 or 5 bifurcate; rachis bracts proximally c. 5 mm long; rachillae 17-24 cm long, 1.5 mm diam., glabrous, with spaced triads. STAMINATE FLOWERS with sepals 1.5-1.8 x 1-2 mm; petals 1.8-2.4 x 1.6-1.7 mm, acute to obtuse; stamens 6, didymous, uniseriate, the filaments 1-1.4 x 0.5-0.6 mm, flat and slightly triangular, anthers 0.4-0.5 mm high, 0.7-0.8 mm wide, dorsifixed; pistillode 1.7-2 x 0.8 mm. PISTILLATE FLOWERS unknown. FRUIT unknown.</div>
<div type="distribution">Manantenina.</div>
<div type="biology_ecology">"Riverside and in the water" (Guillaumet).</div>
<div type="conservation">Uncertain. Probably Endan gered, since it seems to be restricted to a single area.</div>
<div type="uses">Not recorded.</div>
<div type="discussion">Distinct from all other species in the "Vonitra" group by the leaves with scattered scales and much ramenta, as well as by their small size.</div>
<div type="materials_examined">Tolanaro: Manantenina, Dec. 1971 (fl.), Guillaumet 4003a (P).</div>
