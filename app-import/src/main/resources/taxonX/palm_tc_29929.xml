Sheaths, in dried specimen, dull straw-coloured with scattered dark indumentum and various spines, usually reflexed, scattered, rather sparse, 1-10 mm long. Knee conspicuous with short 2 mm long spines along keel; petiole base unarmed on abaxial face; spines around leaf sheath mouth conspicuous, upward pointing. Ocrea inconspicuous. Flagellum about 60 cm. Leaf to 85 cm long, ecirrate; petiole to 11 cm long, armed with short spines to 2 mm long spaced evenly along the margins; leaflets about 60 on each side of the rachis, narrow, regular, close, the largest to 13 cm long by 1 cm wide; leaflets bristly on 3 nerves above and along margins, and very densely bristly along 5 nerves below. Inflorescence, only female known, to 105 cm long with a long terminal flagellum and three partial inflorescences to about 7 cm long; immature fruit somewhat wider than high, about 5 mm high, 4 mm wide covered in 21 vertical rows of reflexed brownish scales.</div>

<div type="uses">None known.</div>
<div type="discussion">This species has been recorded once from a low hillside and once from forest on limestone.
 It seems closest to C. balingensis but may be distinguished by its much smaller size, the narrow bristly leaflets, and the spine-free petiole base.</div>
