<div type="discussion">Calamus reticulatus is a very striking thicket-forming rattan of river-banks. It appears to be an obligate rheophyte, only inhabiting open, sunny areas at river margins where it can grow extremely vigorously, forming vast masses of stem and foliage, which blanket other vegetation. Calamus reticulatus is closely related to C. vestitus, sharing very similar leaf sheath spine and seed morphology. The ocrea, however, is strikingly different. Though tubular like that of C. vestitus, the ocrea of C. reticulatus is composed of a reticulum of fibres which extends well beyond its origin and is stretched around the petiole and flagellum of the leaf sheath above to form a funnel. The ocrea is also armed with numerous needle-like spines. An astonishingly similar ocrea-type can be found in the distantly related rattan genus Korthalsia, K. jalaJ. Dransf. from Borneo. In addition to the ocrea morphology, C. reticulatus can be distinguished from C. vestitus by the more numerous leaflets (56 - 64 each side of rachis in C. reticulatus, 20 - 47 in C. vestitus), and by the longer and more numerous bristles on both surfaces of the leaflets of C. reticulatus. The rheophytic habit of C. reticulatus is also striking; C. vestitus shows no preference for river-banks. Moreover, the known distribution of C. reticulatus is disjunct from that of C. vestitus, being restricted to south-west Papua New Guinea (Map 1).</div>
