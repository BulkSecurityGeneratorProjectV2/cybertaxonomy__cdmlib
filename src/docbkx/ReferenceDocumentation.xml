    <title>Preface</title>

    <para>EDIT's Internet Platform for Cybertaxonomy is a distributed
    computing platform that helps taxonomists do revisionary taxonomy and
    taxonomic field work efficiently and expediently via the web. At the core
    of the platform lies a common data model to enable interoperability
    between the different components. The model describes all the commonly
    used data that is dealt with in the platform, and therefore covers
    taxonomic names and concepts; literature references; authors; (type)
    specimen; structured descriptive data; molecular data; related (binary)
    files such as images or compiled keys; controlled vocabularies and terms;
    and species related content of any kind like economic use or conservation
    status.</para>

    <para>The cyberplatform consists of interoperable but independent
    components. Platform components can take the form of software applications
    (desktop or web-based) for human users or (web) services intended to be
    used by other software applications. The platform as envisioned does not
    have a single user interface or website; rather, it is a collection of
    interacting components which may be combined and assembled according to
    the task in hand. To facilitate the development of core CDM Applications
    such as the CDM Community Server, the CDM Dataportals, and the Taxonomic
    Editor, an implementation of the CDM has been created in the java
    programming language. In addition to CDM model classes being modelled as
    plain-old-java-objects (<link
    xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_Java_Object">pojo's</link>),
    a set of java components has been created that provide common services
    across all java applications using the CDM. In addition to serving as the
    basis of core components of the Internet Platform for Cyberplatform, they
    also allow the development of other applications using the CDM by
    providing basic functionality that can be extended for a particular
    purpose.</para>

    <para>The CDM Library, as it is known, consists of four major modules that
    can be used by any java application based on the CDM. These libraries are
    used as the foundation of the Taxonomic Editor and the CDM Community
    Server. In addition a web application (the CDM Community Server) is
    documented here, as its components can be re-purposed or extended by other
    web applications based on the CDM.</para>

  <part>
    <title>Common Data Model</title>

    <partintro>
      <para>The Common Data Model (CDM) is the domain model for the core EDIT
      cyberplatform components. The CDM is primarily based on the <link
      linkend="???"
      xlink:href="http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/TAG/LsidVocs">TDWG
      Ontology</link> and in most cases there is concordance with relevant
      TDWG standards such as <link linkend="???"
      xlink:href="http://www.tdwg.org/standards/117/">Taxon Concept Transfer
      Schema (TCS)</link>, <link linkend="???"
      xlink:href="http://www.tdwg.org/standards/117/">Structured Descriptive
      Data (SDD)</link> and <link linkend="???"
      xlink:href="http://www.tdwg.org/standards/115/">Access to Biological
      Collections Data (ABCD)</link>.</para>

      <para>The CDM differs from the TDWG standards in its purpose: it is
      intended to serve as the basis of software applications in the
      cyberplatform (e.g. the taxonomic editor, the CDM Dataportals) rather
      than being a standard for data exchange between any resource containing
      biodiversity information. Whilst it is certainly possible to exchange
      data as CDM domain objects serialized as XML or JSON (the CDM Server and
      the CDM Dataportals do this), the common data model is not intended to
      replace existing TDWG standards as a general purpose exchange standard.
      It is possible to convert data held in a CDM store into a relevant TDWG
      standard for exchange and in some cases this may be the desired route
      for data held in the CDM (e.g. for exchange with an application that is
      not part of the cyberplatform, but which is capable of understanding
      data in a TDWG standard).</para>

      <para>Thus the CDM is intended for use as</para>

  <part>
    <title>Persistence Layer</title>

    <partintro>
      <para>Even the most basic of taxonomic applications have a requirement
      for users to be able to save the information that they create. In
      addition, a common component of taxonomic applications is the use of a
      database to provide users with the ability to filter or search their
      data in one way or another. Some applications will require more advanced
      functionality, such as auditing or versioning of data. All of this logic
      is contained in the persistence layer, providing clean separation
      between data access and more taxonomy-centric business logic in the
      service layer.</para>

      <para>Persistence is not a simple problem to solve, especially in
      application developed in Object-Oriented languages, with large amounts
      of data, or with many users accessing data at the same time. The CDM
      Library uses the <link
      xlink:href="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</link> object/relational
      persistence and query service as the basis of its persistence layer.
      Several member projects of the Hibernate stable, including <link
      xlink:href="http://annotations.hibernate.org">Hibernate
      Annotations</link>, <link xlink:href="http://search.hibernate.org">Hibernate Search</link> and
      <link linkend="http://jboss.org/envers/">Hibernate Envers</link> (part of Hibernate Core)
      provide the basis of the more advanced persistence-related functionality
      in the CDM Library. As a consequence some of the behaviour of the CDM
      Library is constrained by the underlying ORM technology. The advantage
      of using an ORM is that the same software can be used with multiple
      database systems with (almost) no changes to the application. Currently
      the CDM Library has been tested with (version numbers &amp; platforms in
      brackets)</para>

      <!--I don't know how many of these have been tested, on which platforms, but it would be good to include some measure of which platform / database combinations 
have been used and how, so that potential users can evaluate the technology. In an ideal world, we would pick some databases as "supported" and ensure that
the test suite runs on that platform / db combination (i.e. you don't release until the tests pass). For the others, we still might want to say: "We tested 
the CDM on this platform and it seemed to work".-->
