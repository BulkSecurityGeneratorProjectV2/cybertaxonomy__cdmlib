 <!-- 
    This is a hibernate configuration which complements the hibernate.cfg.xml
    found in cdmlib-persistence exclusively for a specific phase of the execution
    of integration tests.
    
    This configuration is used to define properties for the session-factory which are
    usually defined in the spring application context (applicationContext-test.common.xml).
    Integration tests which are based on eu.etaxonomy.cdm.test.integration.CdmIntegrationTest 
    are in general using the configuration of the spring application context, except 
    in one situation:
    
    When Unitils calls the afterTestTearDown() method after the execution of a test method
    it is directly using the Hibernate5Module to create a new  session instead of using the 
    spring ApplicationContextManager. Unitils has explicitly configured to behave in this way
    for somr reason (see the property dataSource.wrapInTransactionalProxy=false in 
    /cdmlib-test/src/main/resources/unitils.properties). 
    The session created by the Hibernate5Module gets its configuration only from the file defined 
    in  @HibernateSessionFactory, therefore it misses the additional hibernate configuration 
    properties defined in the spring  application context. 
    In order to create a hibernate only way to define essential configuration properties this 
    file exists.
    
    CdmIntegrationTest is configured to use this configuration file as second source to the 
    main hibernate.cfg.xml. Both configurations are merged:
    
    @HibernateSessionFactory({"/eu/etaxonomy/cdm/hibernate.cfg.xml", "/eu/etaxonomy/cdm/hibernate-test.cfg.xml"})
