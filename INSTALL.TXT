INSTALL WORKSPACE
=====================================
0) * install maven 2.0.x commandline tools locally (http://maven.apache.org/download.html). Follow the instruction to install maven on your local machine.
   * install subclipse 1.4.x in eclipse if not yet installed (Update Site: http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.4.x). 
   * make sure Java JDK >= 1.5 is installed (JRE is not enough) and JAVA_HOME is set to JDK path 

1) Checkout (from outside eclipse) http://dev.e-taxononomy.eu/svn/trunk/cdmLib into a new folder (newFolder).
2) Open newFolder as a new workspace in eclipse (switch to the new workspace by File - Switch Workspace - Other ...)
3) make sure maven has run at least one time (to create the .m2 folder). If unsure how to do this, run "mvn install" in the new checked out folder ../cdmlib/cmlib-commons
4) Set in Eclipse preferences (not project properties) java - buildPath - Classpath Variables M2_REPO , pointing to your local repository. 
      - In OSX for example    /Users/USERNAME/.m2/repository 
      - In WinXP for example  C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\.m2\repository
4 Alternative) use mvn -Declipse.workspace=<path-to-eclipse-workspace> eclipse:add-maven-repo 
5) setup new eclipse workspace (where ever you want but using the cdmlib folder may be comfortable)
6) create new Java project within the new workspace. Check "Create project from existing source" in the dialog. Choose ../cdmlib/cdmlib-commons as the source directory. Use project name "cdmlib-commons".
7) repeat the last step at least for all projects starting with "cdmlib-"
8) Install AspectJ Development Tools (AJDT) - Plugin (for eclipse) 
	(Update-Site:http://download.eclipse.org/tools/ajdt/33/dev/update)
  
9) run "mvn install" and  "mvn eclipse:eclipse" in the parent folder (cdmlib) from command line (e.g. $/eclipse/cdmlib>mvn eclipse:eclipse)
10) Convert the cdmlib-model to AspectJ (right mouse click on project -> AspectJ Tools -> ...).

!! Each time when running mvn eclipse:eclipse on cdmlib-model (or on cdmlib parent folder) you have to first remove and then add AspectJ anew!! 

!!Run mvn eclipse:eclipse each time you change a .pom file
